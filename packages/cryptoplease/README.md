## Architecture overview

We use BLoC-inspired architecture with BLoCs as pure business-logic components and Functional Programming principles in mind.

All the states and events are immutable `freezed` classes.

There are 2 packages related to the application: `cryptoplease` and `cryptoplease_ui`. The first one contains the main code of the app, the second one contains only business-logic-free UI components (think of it as UI-library).

## `crpytoplease` package structure:

### `bl`

All the business logic resides here: models, services, BLoCs. This layer doesn't depend on anything else, but it can declare interfaces (e.g. for repositories) that should be implemented in other layers (most probably, `data`).

### `data`

The implementation of data-related interfaces: repositories, API clients, persistence storages etc.

### `l10n`

Everything related to l10n / i18n.

### `presentation`

Everything related to UI + glue layer for other layers. As for "dependency injection" we use `provider`, classes are initiated in this layer. This is the only layer that depends on Flutter widgets. There should be no *business* logic in this layer, but at the same time, it should contain *presentation* logic. Unlike MVVM approach, we do not separate "dumb" view and "smart" VM as different hierarchy of classes, widgets can play both these roles.

## Running

1. Clone the project.
2. run `make get_all build_all`.
3. Run the application.

## Tests

1. Running unit and golden tests:
   ```sh
   make generate_test_schemas test
   ```
2. Running solana-related integration tests (make sure that local solana instance is installed and running):
   ```sh
   # Ensure that SOLANA_RPC_URL and SOLANA_WEBSOCKET_URL environment variables are set
   make test_solana
   ```
3. Running E2E tests:
   ```sh
   make test_e2e
   ```
